# What is a package?

  #### A package is a set of file/files of code that have been put into a "package" which can offer various tools to your disposal to improve your app, website, etc.

# What is npm?

  #### NPM stands for node package manager. NodeJS is a javascript runtime that is usually used for backend development. NPM basically offers packages for nodejs although people also use it for things such as websites.

# What is yarn?

  #### Yarn is also a package manager. It is basically the samething as NPM although the CLI is slightly different. 
 
# How to install a package?

  #### To install a package, go into terminal/build in terminal(from your text editor, if they have it of course) and type in npm init(init stands for initialization).
  #### Important note, if NodeJS is NOT built into your text editor then you would have to download it. npm init is to make a json file that records all the packages that you have.
  #### An example of built in NodeJS. repl.it is a online text editor that is amazing and has a built in NodeJS environment.
  #### For example if you want to move your app to a different place, you would only need to move package.json and not your node modules. To reinstall the node modules just do npm install or npm i
  #### Alright after you have set everything up you will now install your package/packages. To do so in the terminal type: npm i packagenamehere You can also do npm install packagenamehere
  #### i in npm i stands for install. Example: npm i express
  #### The example above would install express as a dependency. If you want to only install it for developement and not for production you can put a -D or --dev
  #### Example: npm i -D nodemon
  #### nodemon is another npm package that auto restarts your server and is great for developement.

# How to install a package in yarn?

  #### Pretty much the same thing as above. yarn init, yarn add instead of install although if you have the packages in package.json you can just do yarn install.
  
# How to UNINSTALL a package in yarn/npm?

  #### npm uninstall packagenamehere/yarn remove packagenamehere
  
# If you have a question I would recommend looking at the yarn/npm CLI.
